1. Introduction                                                   *pathaction*


Execute pathaction.yaml rules using the pathaction command-line tool from
Vim.

(The pathaction command-line tool enables the execution of specific commands on
targeted files or directories. Its key advantage lies in its flexibility,
allowing users to handle various types of files simply by passing the file or
directory as an argument to the pathaction tool. The tool uses a
.pathaction.yaml rule-set file to determine which command to execute.
Additionally, Jinja2 templating can be employed in the rule-set file to further
customize the commands.)

Usage:
>
  :call pathaction#run("main")
<
